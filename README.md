## 🧩 Module Descriptions

### **00_Setup.md**
Covers Python installation, environment setup, and configuration.  
Includes instructions for installing Python, setting up IDEs like VS Code or PyCharm, and managing virtual environments.

### **02_Working_with_data/**
Explores Python’s data structures and data manipulation techniques.  
Topics include:
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- File I/O operations  
- Working with CSV, JSON, and other data formats  

### **03_Program_organization/**
Teaches modular programming practices in Python.  
Learn about:
- Functions and namespaces  
- Code reuse and maintainability  
- Structuring Python scripts for clarity and scalability  

### **04_Classes_objects/**
Introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles:
- Defining classes and objects  
- Constructors and destructors  
- Instance vs class variables  
- Encapsulation and inheritance  

### **05_Object_model/**
Dives deeper into Python’s internal object model and OOP mechanisms:
- Understanding `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`  
- Method resolution order (MRO)  
- Customizing class behavior using special methods  

### **06_Generators/**
Explains **iterators** and **generators**, key for efficient looping:
- The `yield` keyword  
- Lazy evaluation  
- Generator expressions and performance benefits  

### **07_Advanced_Topics/**
Focuses on advanced Python concepts such as:
- Decorators and context managers  
- Functional programming with `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`  
- Lambda functions  
- Error handling best practices  

### **08_Testing_debugging/**
Covers software reliability and debugging tools:
- Writing unit tests using `unittest` or `pytest`  
- Debugging with `pdb`  
- Logging and exception tracing  

### **09_Packages/**
Explains how to structure Python projects as reusable packages:
- Creating and using modules  
- `__init__.py` and package imports  
- Installing packages with `pip`  
- Best practices for project organization  

### **Contents.md**
A table of contents linking to all lessons and submodules.

### **InstructorNotes.md**
Contains additional insights, exercises, or teaching guidelines to accompany the documentation.

### **Introduction/**
Introductory materials about Python programming, goals of the documentation, and usage tips.
